Whats interesting is that they haven't included our logo (we were in from an acquiring pov) but have included Adyen. Given their book - i find this a touch concerning. I know we can't pursue two strategic partnerships - and that its not the best use of Stripe to be an endpoint in another orchestrator. But considering they are the #2 player, and possibly still #1 on pay-ins, I think we should engage a plats AE to see if we can at least get our payments solution into the platform - as much from a "no disqualification" pov as anything else.

They take on contracted liability for ongoing support/maintenance/upgrades of marketplace integrations. The majority of Insurance businesses they've worked with have started with pre-existing Guidewire marketplace integrations before moving on to custom builds. "Land with Guidewire then expand." They agreed to share a list of ~195 current/prospective Insurance users with business cases that Stripe may be able to solve for—we didn't ask about the overlap with Guidewire and can do so when the list is shared. Either way they agreed that driving customer leads our way, whether direct or through Guidewire, would be a key aspect of the partnership.

We are recommending Endava due to their deep experience with Stripe and the fact that they have already created the on-prem connector - we believe their ramp will be fast. User1 is working on our final recommendation to be shared XFN early next week. I think there is value in User1 reviewing our planned approach with Infosys to get their take and our A&C team engaging them in our GTM strategy but I don't recommend we ask them to pitch us a proposal at this point

More than anything, my hope is that we don't lose momentum on the partnership in general, as we already know it's leading us to 3 named user workshops and a list of 195 other Insurance businesses. [[user7]] let me know if I'm thinking about it the wrong way, but a discussion on the topic of connectors doesn't come with an obligation or an expectation—we can do the quick discovery and then come back and say "let's focus on direct to start because we have the demand".

If there are no admin roadblocks and Infosys is fully contracted and in our systems, then User1 is open to a quick discussion if they can get it scheduled ASAP next week, just in case they bring something to the table that blows Endava out of the water. We've already stressed in the email thread that we're on a major time crunch to make a decision; we'l be sure to stress this in the meeting as well in order to set clear expectations. We will highlight that, Connector or not, we're committed to continuing discovery with them on non-Marketplace Guidewire-to-user integrations. The direct opportunities with Travelers, MassMutual, and The Hartford are still very much something we want to pursue, and we also have no shortage of Guidewire-to-user opportunities that could use the expertise of a dedicated partner if there's a fit.

We will highlight that, Connector or not, we're committed to continuing discovery with them on non-Marketplace Guidewire-to-user integrations. The direct opportunities with Travelers, MassMutual, and The Hartford are still very much something we want to pursue, and we also have no shortage of Guidewire-to-user opportunities that could use the expertise of a dedicated partner if there's a fit.

> We haven't notified them yet [[user2]] , we were hoping to get a more detailed BBG quote from User3 this week (still waiting to hear back). Estimated timeline Endava gave us was min-22weeks from when we kick off the engamement to build all of the integrations we scoped One thing we would like to know [[user2]] is if Guidewire would be able to provide us with development licenses / instances for us to develop against? Endava are saying there is a $25k pass-through license cost from Guidewire to obtain this, which seems excessive and not very in the spirit of a strategic partnership with us. (edited)

> [[user5]] organized a super positive Insurance Solutioning Workshop with Infosys in the NY office today :rocket::mvp_text:. A more comprehensive update will be coming soon with additional AIs, but we wanted to get this one on your radar quickly [[user1]] [[user6]] since there's a 3/10 target date for a decision on the Guidewire Connector approach in the SteerCo doc: Infosys team showed high interest in our Guidewire Connector integration strategy—they're eager to hold a follow-up meeting to discuss partnering on building for the Marketplace. I know we're close with Endava, but the benefits Infosys mentioned make this worth exploring before gaveling on the build partner decision: They have 200+ Guidewire-certified employees. They already have sandbox instances we'd be able to use for the Connectors without paying to obtain them from Guidewire. They take on contracted liability for ongoing support/maintenance/upgrades of marketplace integrations. The majority of Insurance businesses they've worked with have started with pre-existing Guidewire marketplace integrations before moving on to custom builds. "Land with Guidewire then expand." They agreed to share a list of ~195 current/prospective Insurance users with business cases that Stripe may be able to solve for—we didn't ask about the overlap with Guidewire and can do so when the list is shared. Either way they agreed that driving customer leads our way, whether direct or through Guidewire, would be a key aspect of the partnership. Let me know if I've misrepresented or missed anything (and huge thanks to you and the rest of the team that contributed to the workshop 🙌 [[user7]] [[user8]] [[user9]] [[user10]] [[user11]] ).

> Hi all - I spoke to User1 about this earlier. We've already spent weeks working with Endava and Guidewire on this and I hesitate to bring in a new variable at this point. We are recommending Endava due to their deep experience with Stripe and the fact that they have already created the on-prem connector - we believe their ramp will be fast. User1 is working on our final recommendation to be shared XFN early next week. I think there is value in User1 reviewing our planned approach with Infosys to get their take and our A&C team engaging them in our GTM strategy but I don't recommend we ask them to pitch us a proposal at this point

> [!slack]+ Message from Thanks for the Clarity
> **Time:** 
> [[user6]] but I think it may cause the wrong expectation with Infosys if we validate our approach with them if we've already decided to go with another partner. They were very eager to have a discussion around the potential of building a connector when [[user4]] proposed it. Shall we rethink having the call? I'd need to think about the way to frame it given they've been asking us to get in front of work like this for them and we were already far along with Endava. Cc [[user5]] [[user10]]

> That works for me, just want to double-confirm that we feel the benefits we gain with Endava outweigh some of the benefits Infosys had mentioned: They have 200+ Guidewire-certified employees. They already have sandbox instances we'd be able to use for the Connectors without paying to obtain them from Guidewire. They take on contracted liability for ongoing support/maintenance/upgrades of marketplace integrations.

> **Time:** 
> As long as we're happy with what Endava offers in comparison (e.g., speed to ramp) and the benefits of going with Endava will drive the ultimate goal of expanding our customer pipeline, then I'm peaceful with the decision. I think there is value in User1 reviewing our planned approach with Infosys to get their take and our A&C team engaging them in our GTM strategy Whichever we're going with, I think we should still have the quick follow-up call with Infosys, since it will not even include their offshore Guidewire development team next week (it will be more information-trading rather than validation/proposal of any solution, which [[user1]] [[user6]] I think you still may find intriguing). More than anything, my hope is that we don't lose momentum on the partnership in general, as we already know it's leading us to 3 named user workshops and a list of 195 other Insurance businesses. [[user7]] let me know if I'm thinking about it the wrong way, but a discussion on the topic of connectors doesn't come with an obligation or an expectation—we can do the quick discovery and then come back and say "let's focus on direct to start because we have the demand".

Would just like to understand a little more about decisions and next steps and context I might have missed from separate threads, and then happy to disagree and commit if needed! One more chime in here - is there a world in which we use both? Does the GW work need to be exclusive? For Connectors it's probably best to go with one for the suite, but then we could use other partners like Infosys for the custom Guidewire integrations with users.

> User1 and I just caught up, here's a recap: Most importantly, User1 flagged that the benefit of speed we get from Endava is partially because they're in our LDAP, they're in our JIRA, we have an SoW with them—basically, all the legal/logistical/admin details are already taken care of, they're fully integrated. [[user7]] [[user9]] do you know if Infosys is already set up with us in the same way from any prior engagement? If not, we'l have to go through contracting, legal redlines, provisioning, permissions, etc ... this process will push us far past the June 30th integration deadline. If this is the case, the Connector discussion is a moot point and we keep focus on Guidewire-to-user direct. If there are no admin roadblocks and Infosys is fully contracted and in our systems, then User1 is open to a quick discussion if they can get it scheduled ASAP next week, just in case they bring something to the table that blows Endava out of the water. We've already stressed in the email thread that we're on a major time crunch to make a decision; we'l be sure to stress this in the meeting as well in order to set clear expectations.

Need to run a whole bunch of other slack copy and pastes through it I'm sure there are more cases I haven't accounted for, what you get in a raw copy and paste is limited but might be able to preserve the images that come over in it.

I tried selecting all the messages in one entire thread in Slack, copying, and then using Cmd-shift-V to paste into Obsidian, and got nothing whatsoever as output. Hitting just Cmd-V does paste the usual badly formatted stuff, so I know it's in the clipboard. Then I tried doing the same with this very thread, and found that it did paste, but only about the last half of the thread. Any thoughts?"

I tried selecting all the messages in one entire thread in Slack, copying, and then using Cmd-shift-V to paste into Obsidian, and got nothing whatsoever as output. Hitting just Cmd-V does paste the usual badly formatted stuff, so I know it's in the clipboard. Then I tried doing the same with this very thread, and found that it did paste, but only about the last half of the thread. Any thoughts?"

> Interested in querying my Obsidian vault with Gemini, which doesn't seem to support Markdown very well. Does anyone know a way of converting the vault to e.g. a single Google Doc, or uploading the entire thing to [https://notebooklm.google.com/](https://notebooklm.google.com/)? ![](https://ca.slack-edge.com/E0181S17H6Z-U069XJPRN6T-81d92fec1f7e-24)![](https://ca.slack-edge.com/E0181S17H6Z-U07JC6P29UM-67fda94224a3-24)2 replies

> Made another thing mostly for myself but thought I'd share here incase anyone else finds it useful. Basic functionality is it searches all notes in the vault for the tag #tasks and the Tasks plugin format for tasks \`- [ ]\` (customization of both available in settings) then presents them as a dynamically updating ToDo list in the side pane, which also allows you to check/uncheck tasks in your notes. Completed notes are moved to the bottom. You can activate the side pane with the checkbox icon on the left side-bar or with the hotkey (defined in settings). Suggestions welcome!Oh, not relevant for Stripe Vault's due to policy, but also support mobile (for those personal todo lists)[https://github.com/amittell/obsidian-dynamic-todo-list/](https://github.com/amittell/obsidian-dynamic-todo-list/)Current backlog: - Make an option to allow task note to be identified by filename or note header, currently only filename is supported. - Add a folder base include/exclude filter. - Sort better sorting of tagged task notes, allow the user to sort by created and last updated, make the default a setting. - Archiving of completed notes - don't show completed notes older than X date for 'last updated'.
