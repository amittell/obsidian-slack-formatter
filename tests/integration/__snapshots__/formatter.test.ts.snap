Whats interesting is that they haven't included our logo (we were in from an acquiring pov) but have included Adyen. Given their book - i find this a touch concerning. I know we can't pursue two strategic partnerships - and that its not the best use of Stripe to be an endpoint in another orchestrator. But considering they are the #2 player, and possibly still #1 on pay-ins, I think we should engage a plats AE to see if we can at least get our payments solution into the platform - as much from a "no disqualification" pov as anything else.

We are recommending Endava due to their deep experience with Stripe and the fact that they have already created the on-prem connector - we believe their ramp will be fast. User1 is working on our final recommendation to be shared XFN early next week. I think there is value in User1 reviewing our planned approach with Infosys to get their take and our A&C team engaging them in our GTM strategy but I don't recommend we ask them to pitch us a proposal at this point

We are recommending Endava due to their deep experience with Stripe and the fact that they have already created the on-prem connector - we believe their ramp will be fast. User1 is working on our final recommendation to be shared XFN early next week. I think there is value in User1 reviewing our planned approach with Infosys to get their take and our A&C team engaging them in our GTM strategy but I don't recommend we ask them to pitch us a proposal at this point
