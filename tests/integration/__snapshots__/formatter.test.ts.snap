> **Time:** 
> [[user2]] is if Guidewire would be able to provide us with development licenses / instances for us to develop against? Endava are saying there is a $25k pass-through license cost from Guidewire to obtain this, which seems excessive and not very in the spirit of a strategic partnership with us. (edited) Also sent to the channel User4 Wednesday at 8:19 PM [[user5]] organized a super positive Insurance Solutioning Workshop with Infosys in the NY office today :rocket::mvp_text:. A more comprehensive update will be coming soon with additional AIs, but we wanted to get this one on your radar quickly [[user1]] [[user6]] since there's a 3/10 target date for a decision on the Guidewire Connector approach in the SteerCo doc: Infosys team showed high interest in our Guidewire Connector integration strategy—they're eager to hold a follow-up meeting to discuss partnering on building for the Marketplace. I know we're close with Endava, but the benefits Infosys mentioned make this worth exploring before gaveling on the build partner decision: They have 200+ Guidewire-certified employees.

> [!slack]+ Message from Unknown User
> **Time:** 
> The majority of Insurance businesses they've worked with have started with pre-existing Guidewire marketplace integrations before moving on to custom builds. "Land with Guidewire then expand." They agreed to share a list of ~195 current/prospective Insurance users with business cases that Stripe may be able to solve for—we didn't ask about the overlap with Guidewire and can do so when the list is shared. Either way they agreed that driving customer leads our way, whether direct or through Guidewire, would be a key aspect of the partnership.
>
> I think there is value in User1 reviewing our planned approach with Infosys to get their take and our A&C team engaging them in our GTM strategy Whichever we're going with, I think we should still have the quick follow-up call with Infosys, since it will not even include their offshore Guidewire development team next week (it will be more information-trading rather than validation/proposal of any solution, which [[user1]] [[user6]] I think you still may find intriguing). More than anything, my hope is that we don't lose momentum on the partnership in general, as we already know it's leading us to 3 named user workshops and a list of 195 other Insurance businesses. [[user7]] let me know if I'm thinking about it the wrong way, but a discussion on the topic of connectors doesn't come with an obligation or an expectation—we can do the quick discovery and then come back and say "let's focus on direct to start because we have the demand".

> I've updated the pluggin to handle DM conversation imports. Need to run a whole bunch of other slack copy and pastes through it I'm sure there are more cases I haven't accounted for, what you get in a raw copy and paste is limited but might be able to preserve the images that come over in it. The intercept cmd+V is currently non-functional I know about that one. 👍 🙏1

> Hi [@alexm](https://stripe.slack.com/team/U07JC6P29UM), thanks for your work on this! Having installed the latest version (0.0.6), I'm having a bit of trouble making it paste as expected. I tried selecting all the messages in one entire thread in Slack, copying, and then using Cmd-shift-V to paste into Obsidian, and got nothing whatsoever as output. Hitting just Cmd-V does paste the usual badly formatted stuff, so I know it's in the clipboard. Then I tried doing the same with this very thread, and found that it did paste, but only about the last half of the thread. Any thoughts?"

> Made another thing mostly for myself but thought I'd share here incase anyone else finds it useful. Basic functionality is it searches all notes in the vault for the tag #tasks and the Tasks plugin format for tasks \`- [ ]\` (customization of both available in settings) then presents them as a dynamically updating ToDo list in the side pane, which also allows you to check/uncheck tasks in your notes. Completed notes are moved to the bottom. You can activate the side pane with the checkbox icon on the left side-bar or with the hotkey (defined in settings).
