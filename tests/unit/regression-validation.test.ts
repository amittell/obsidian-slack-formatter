#CONTEXT#
You're finding the rep's longest monologue in a transcript. A monologue only ends if the prospect speaks for ≥10 seconds.
#OBJECTIVE#
Analyze the call transcript and return the rep's longest uninterrupted monologue, following the specified rules.
#INSTRUCTIONS#
1. Analyze the /f_0sxfv1exQCiSZErKsV5.transcript .
2. Clearly identify every segment of continuous rep speech. Continuous rep speech is broken only by prospect interruptions lasting 10 seconds or more.
3. For every prospect interruption that occurs between rep speech segments, explicitly identify:
Interruption timestamp (start and end)
Exact interruption duration in seconds
4. Calculate whether the interruption breaks (≥10 seconds) or does not break (<10 seconds) the monologue.
If the monologue was ≥10 seconds, treat that as a break and start a new rep segment after the prospect finishes talking.
If the monologue was not broken, ignore the interruption and continue counting the rep's monologue.
5. Repeat the process until the end of the call.
6. Identify and return the rep's longest monologue, including its duration in seconds.
7. Output only the monologue's duration in the specified format.
#EXAMPLES#
Input: Transcript with alternating rep and prospect turns, with some prospect turns under and some over 10 seconds.
Expected Output:
DurationSeconds: [120]
