> - as an aside, just visited Duck Creek's payments page again. They've now fully baked in emburse as a payments orchestrator - and are calling it Duck Creek Payments.. Whats interesting is that they haven't included our logo (we were in from an acquiring pov) but have included Adyen. Given their book - i find this a touch concerning. I know we can't pursue two strategic partnerships - and that its not the best use of Stripe to be an endpoint in another orchestrator. But considering they are the #2 player, and possibly still #1 on pay-ins, I think we should engage a plats AE to see if we can at least get our payments solution into the platform - as much from a "no disqualification" pov as anything else.

I know we're close with Endava, but the benefits Infosys mentioned make this worth exploring before gaveling on the build partner decision:
> They have 200+ Guidewire-certified employees.
> They already have sandbox instances we'd be able to use for the Connectors without paying to obtain them from Guidewire.
> They take on contracted liability for ongoing support/maintenance/upgrades of marketplace integrations.
> The majority of Insurance businesses they've worked with have started with pre-existing Guidewire marketplace integrations before moving on to custom builds. "Land with Guidewire then expand."
> They agreed to share a list of ~195 current/prospective Insurance users with business cases that Stripe may be able to solve for-we didn't ask about the overlap with Guidewire and can do so when the list is shared. Either way they agreed that driving customer leads our way, whether direct or through Guidewire, would be a key aspect of the partnership.

> Hi all - I spoke to User1 about this earlier. We've already spent weeks working with Endava and Guidewire on this and I hesitate to bring in a new variable at this point. We are recommending Endava due to their deep experience with Stripe and the fact that they have already created the on-prem connector - we believe their ramp will be fast. User1 is working on our final recommendation to be shared XFN early next week. I think there is value in User1 reviewing our planned approach with Infosys to get their take and our A&C team engaging them in our GTM strategy but I don't recommend we ask them to pitch us a proposal at this point

> User1 and I just caught up, here's a recap:
> Most importantly, User1 flagged that the benefit of speed we get from Endava is partially because they're in our LDAP, they're in our JIRA, we have an SoW with them-basically, all the legal/logistical/admin details are already taken care of, they're fully integrated.
> [[user7]]
>
> [[user9]]
> do you know if Infosys is already set up with us in the same way from any prior engagement? If not, we'l have to go through contracting, legal redlines, provisioning, permissions, etc ... this process will push us far past the June 30th integration deadline. If this is the case, the Connector discussion is a moot point and we keep focus on Guidewire-to-user direct.
> If there are no admin roadblocks and Infosys is fully contracted and in our systems, then User1 is open to a quick discussion if they can get it scheduled ASAP next week, just in case they bring something to the table that blows Endava out of the water. We've already stressed in the email thread that we're on a major time crunch to make a decision; we'l be sure to stress this in the meeting as well in order to set clear expectations.
> We will highlight that, Connector or not, we're committed to continuing discovery with them on non-Marketplace Guidewire-to-user integrations. The direct opportunities with Travelers, MassMutual, and The Hartford are still very much something we want to pursue, and we also have no shortage of Guidewire-to-user opportunities that could use the expertise of a dedicated partner if there's a fit.
