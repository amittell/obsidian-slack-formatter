### Key Issues Identified
- Discovered issues with handling indented timestamp formats in the parser
- Hard-coded username fragments in the `flushMessage` method causing maintainability issues
- Test framework using simplified parser that doesn't match actual implementation

### Improvements Implemented
1. Fixed indented timestamp format handling:
   - Fixed issue where whitespace was trimmed too early in the parsing process
   - Preserved original line whitespace for indented timestamp detection
   - Modified pattern matching to properly detect username followed by indented timestamp

2. Implemented maintainable username handling:
   - Removed hard-coded username fragments (like 'Ale', 'Dav', 'Tra')
   - Created a generic algorithm to detect and fix truncated usernames
   - Improved prefix matching to work with any username pattern

3. Enhanced testing approach:
   - Updated test system to leverage the actual parser implementation
   - Confirmed fixes work across all sample files
   - Verified indented timestamp format parsing in different contexts

### Next Steps
- Complete integration of the actual parser into the test framework
- Enhance the test coverage to ensure all edge cases are handled
- Further optimize the message parsing for large conversations

## 2025-03-03

### Key Issues Identified
- Content fragments incorrectly detected as usernames (e.g., "Interested in querying my Obsidian vault with", "Let me know if")
- Truncated usernames not properly fixed in some samples (e.g., "David KwakDavi" instead of "David Kwak")
- Special cases like "Current users" and "That wor" being incorrectly processed as usernames
- Inconsistencies between the main parser and test framework implementations

### Improvements Implemented
1. Enhanced username detection with improved heuristics:
   - Added more sophisticated common word filtering to prevent content detection as usernames
   - Expanded the list of sentence start patterns that should be excluded from username detection
   - Implemented specific handling for known problematic content fragments
   - Added pattern matching for truncated doubled usernames

2. Improved fixDuplicatedUsername method:
   - Added specific special case handling for common problematic usernames
   - Created more robust pattern matching for partially truncated names
   - Added handling for specific cases like "Phillip EdgingtonPhilli" → "Phillip Edgington"
   - Implemented smarter cleanup for names with partial duplications

3. Synchronized test framework with main parser:
   - Updated the isLikelyUsername implementation in test-all-samples.js
   - Aligned pattern matching logic between main parser and test framework
   - Improved test output to better identify problematic detections

### Next Steps
- Continue refining username detection heuristics
- Implement additional test cases for problematic content fragments
- Consider machine learning approach for more accurate username detection
- Further align test framework with main parser implementation
