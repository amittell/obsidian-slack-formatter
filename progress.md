# Obsidian Slack Formatter - Progress Log

## 2025-02-27

### Initial Analysis
- Analyzed sample Slack paste with formatting issues
- Identified key problems:
  1. Doubled usernames (e.g., "Alex MittellAlex Mittell")
  2. Missing author detection in message structure
  3. Timestamp parsing inconsistencies
  4. Image/attachment formatting issues
  5. Thread structure preservation problems

### Setup
- Created tracking files: goals.md, tasks.md, progress.md
- Established priority issues based on example paste

### Implementation Plan
1. Improve message detection algorithm to better handle various Slack paste formats
2. Enhance username extraction with better handling of duplicated names
3. Create more robust initial content handling for pastes with unclear structure
4. Fix avatar and image handling
5. Improve URL and link formatting

## 2025-02-28

### Code Analysis
- Analyzed current plugin structure and identified critical areas for improvement
- Identified several username parsing edge cases not handled by current code
- Found issues with initial content attribution when no clear user is detected

### Improvements Implemented
1. Enhanced username deduplication with more sophisticated pattern matching
2. Improved initial content handling with better "missing" attribution
3. Fixed avatar image processing and attachment handling
4. Added more robust handling of content with emoji in usernames
5. Added better debug logging for issue diagnosis

### Next Steps
- Test with various Slack paste formats
- Implement more comprehensive message boundary detection
- Fix issues with thread replies and nested content

### Key Issues Identified
- Found critical problem in message parser not correctly identifying Slack content
- Preview pane failing due to method references errors
- Cmd+Shift+V hotkey not reliably intercepting paste events
- Syntax errors in multiple files causing build failures

### Improvements Implemented

   - Added error handling in preview generation

3. Keyboard Handling:
   - Implemented multiple strategies for capturing Cmd+Shift+V:
     - Added dedicated command with hotkey registration
     - Added direct DOM event listener with capture phase
     - Enhanced paste event handler with better prevention

4. Code Organization:
   - Fixed syntax errors across multiple files
   - Improved structure of modals.ts
   - Enhanced error reporting throughout the codebase

### Next Steps
- Continue testing with different Slack paste formats
- Implement additional message format detection patterns
- Improve performance for large Slack conversations
- Add comprehensive documentation for common patterns
