Anyone else got beef with :partner: emoji? :eyes:
Our partner merchant ids are in the format krn:partner:global:account:live:<suffix> so half of the time they get pasted as just "krn:partner:global:account:live"
Also noticing the replacement a lot in automated messages since we've a bunch of ruby packages called partner

wts: :bufo-clap: is a very low quality emoji for how often it gets used (purely because of bufo/SEO). if someone creates a cleaner version, I'll gladly give up the emoji namespace to them. It is a >p99 bufo according to go/emoji-scoreboard (edited)

Has anyone studied bufo's migration? as I understand it many ex-stripes spread bufo to OpenAI, and Notion… where else?

Last year we launched custom emojis in Notion :chefs-kiss:
But how do you add 1.5M custom emojis to a workspace without breaking everything? :thinking_face: (91 kB)

:wave: I'm looking for help removing a reactji, specifically looking to retire jira-archreview-ask :jira-archreview-ask: since that forum is deprecated. I cleaned up the go/askbot-sheet to remove the behavior, but the emoji is owned by a former Stripe.
